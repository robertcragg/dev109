          <h2>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h2>
          <p class="answer">Answer:</p>
          Before this course I had a limited knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had previously completed Khan Academy's introductory Web Development courses in the fall of 2023, which did give me a limited understanding of these technologies. I had also explored JavaScript in the form of brute forced coding solutions that I created using Google App Script during my tenure in the retail Cannabis industry.<br><br>I was responsible for managing and administrating a wide array of different workflows, business solutions, and technology platforms in my previous capacity as buyer for a multi-store retail Cannabis chain in Snohomish County. During that time I developed a passion for trying to automate and streamline my own workflows, which I then expounded upon by improving the efficiency of the entire business. I was also able to work extensively alongside the largest SaaS service provider in the industry (Dutchie Inc.) as I managed the transition of our company's tech-stack to their flagship Point of Sale product. That is really where my interest for software development began, and is what spurred me to re-enroll in college after transitioning out of that position.

          <h2>Did you use a template, or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</h2>
          <p class="answer">Answer:</p>
          I did not use a fully pre-built template, as I thought that would potentially impede the valuable learning process that happens when you come up with an idea, and then try to bring it to fruition. My strategy was to iterate on, and improve the basic layout that was provided during Module 04. I continued to update that design as I worked to complete the Midterm, and then further improved on the design during the Final.<br><br>With that being said, I did adopt and then modify some pre-built design elements in my project, specifically the navigation bar and dimensional header design that I used for each page. I changed some key elements of the CSS for each of those components so that they would better flow with the overall style of my portfolio. Overall I am proud of my final design, but I know there is still a lot of room for improvement.

          <h2>What was the most challenging part of your portfolio?</h2>
          <p class="answer">Answer:</p>
          The most challenging component of the portfolio for me was finishing it on time. I am an extreme perfectionist by nature, and therefore am not happy unless I am able to fully execute on the vision I have in my head. In this instance that meant accomplishing something that not only met the requirements, but that also looked good and used some modern layout elements.<br><br>Because of that, I made the decision to use CSS Grid as a component of my portfolio, and that presented some new challenges as I had no prior experience using that before I started on my final. I also made the nearly fatal mistake of not checking my CSS in the W3C Validator until I was already 80% of the way done with my project, at which point I discovered some serious issues with my code. This caused me to have to go back through large swaths of my design, and fix parse errors that came from attempting to nest code in a way that was not allowed in Vanilla CSS.

          <h2>How did this class change your view on Web Development?</h2>
          <p class="answer">Answer:</p>
          Where do I even start....Before I began this course I had some comfortable delusions about software development that I have henceforth been disabused of. I was initially a little cocky, and I thought that because this was an introductory level course that I would be able to breeze through the content as I am generally a quick learner, and I have excelled at picking up technical concepts in the past. While I was able to effectively progress through the course work, I also quickly began to realize exactly how limited my knowledge of software development truly was. I have always loved computers and technology, but I only recently developed a passion to explore it as a potential career option.<br><br>Now that I have completed this course I have a newfound respect for the challenge that is ahead of me if I am going to seriously pursue a career in software development or computer science. With that being said, I do see myself gravitating more towards front-end development and the creative abstraction that goes along with it. So, for that reason this class has been a valuable tool. It allowed me to begin exploring which areas of the technology ecosystem I want to specialize in, both as a matter of necessity in choosing a major, as well as understanding what roles I may be best suited for as I work towards completing a career transition.

          <h2>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h2>
          <p class="answer">Answer:</p>
          The online learning setting of this class was much more free-form, and undirected than I was expecting. If you are not comfortable dealing with ambiguity, or taking responsibility for managing your own learning process then this is not the course for you. The predominant modality for learning new concepts that are relevant to the course work each week are LinkedIn Learning companion courses, which I did think were both relevant and of high quality. However, there was rarely enough time to complete them in their entirety over the course of a given week, especially if you are trying to experiment with the knowledge that was imparted in a functional way.<br><br>I don't wish to be overly harsh, as I do believe that I was able to absorb a lot of valuable Web Development concepts over the last several months. However, I was also routinely stressed out by the layout of this course, and I thought the quantity of information provided was a at times a bit overwhelming. Therefore, my earnest suggestion for future students would be to take this course for what it is, at face value: a prerequisite for completing your degree. However, I would not suggest that future students should expect this to be a heavily regimented, or perfectly guided pathway to developing a full fledged foundational understanding of Web Development. If you want to accomplish that you are going to need to independently leverage the knowledge and utilities this course points you towards as you continue your software development journey.
