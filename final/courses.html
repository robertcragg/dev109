              <p><b><em>Instructor:</em></b> Professor Matthew Edwards</p>
              <p class="t-left"><b><em>Previous Knowledge in the Subject?:</em></b> As a returning student I have had well over a decade worth of experience in the workforce. I have managed many different teams of various sizes, across several different businesses in that time. With that being said, it is always nice to get some additional perspective on how to best approach your professional life, and learn new concepts that can benefit you as you progress into a new phase of your career.</p>
              <p class="t-left"><b><em>Knowledge & Skills Gained:</em></b> Over the course of this class I learned a significant number of new concepts relating to workplace politicking, power dynamics, conflict resolution, and cultural differences. It was definitely a worthwhile course in my opionion, and I got a lot of useful feedback from Professor Edwards along the way. It was also nice to sharpen up on my writting skills as it has been many years since I was regularly undertaking long-form written assignments.</p>

              <a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=14&coid=57598" target="_blank">DEV-109<br>Intro to Web Development</a>
              <p><b><em>Instructor:</em></b> Professor Adam Brehm</p>
              <p class="t-left"><b><em>Previous Knowledge in the Subject?:</em></b> I had some very basic knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript previous to this class. Everything I had learned before this was a result of brute-forcing solutions in Google App Script for one of my previous roles. Through that I was able to pick up some limited background knowledge that I was able to extrapolate into something functional for this course. I knew just enough of the basics to trick myself into a false sense of security, but not enough to understand exactly how little I really knew about software development.</p>
              <p class="t-left"><b><em>Knowledge & Skills Gained:</em></b> To be honest, I am a bit torn in regards to what I actually learned in this class. I know I have progressed significantly from where I started, but I still feel like I have barely even broken the surface. I know just enough to get frustrated when I am unable to execute on the wireframe vision I have in my mind. I spent well over 24 hours on this final alone, and I still think it is shoddy at best. With that being said, my code is a little cleaner than when I started, and I have a slightly better grasp on layouts. So, I will call this class a net win even though it was frustrating as hell at times.</p>

              <p><b><em>Instructor:</em></b> Professor Agnes Figueroa</p>
              <p class="t-left"><b><em>Previous Knowledge in the Subject?:</em></b> I had a significant amount of experience with home & small business networking before I started in this course. I have been building and mantaining small networks for the majority of my life, but I never really had a deeper understanding of what was going on until now. What I enjoyed was really being able to dig into the more complex networking concepts that were presented along the way, as it provided that much needed context that took my knowledge to the next level.</p>
              <p class="t-left"><b><em>Knowledge & Skills Gained:</em></b> I learned a great deal about the infrastructure that allows global networking to function, as well as what all of the network protocols and standards actually mean. It was great to be able to build more practical knoledge around how the process of sending and receiving data actually occurs. It is amazing what we are able to accomplish simply by sending elecrtrical impulses that represent binary numbers. We take it for granted, but the complexity that goes into network technology is truly astonishing.</p>
