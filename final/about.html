If nothing else I want to take this time to further my education so that I can potentially make it past the paper ceiling that comes with not having a degree. Previously I worked in the commerical Cannabis industry for over a decade, but I have seen enough of that drama for one lifetime. Perhaps if the tide turns, and there are more technology jobs available in that industry after I graduate I will be able to merge my new found skills with my existing experience pool in order to find something innovate to do in that space again.
